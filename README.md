# LSPainter

Hi there! I’m Alex and I’ve made a local search painter. It’s a local search solver that tries to copy a given image using its own “brushes”. The simplest version just keeps generating random shapes, determining if the canvas would look more like the original with the shape or not, and drawing accordingly. Bit by bit, a resemblance emerges from the infinite randomness, and a copy is born.

I’m also trying other “art styles” by designing different solution types. For instance, a limited number of shapes, so you have to find the best combination. Or a [planar subdivision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_straight-line_graph) of the canvas (in the making), giving it a whole different look. There is a lot more I want to do with this project, much more to explore!

This project is my first big project, so I may not have the best structure. I’m trying to redesign parts from time to time and I’m always open to suggestions on how to do so. What this project is most about is the Fun™ computing science bits I did in it. I’ve made my own maths library, as well as some data structures and algorithms. I’m also trying to figure out new stuff in C#, it’s a pretty fun language to learn.

## TODOs

 - **Planar subdivision** - make operations for the solution
 - **Parameter fine-tuner** - find the best parameters to solve a problem faster
 - **Write documenation** - I want to make the project more presentable
